# **Hate Speech and Offensive Language Analysis in Tweets | Classification Project**  

## **INTRODUCTION**  
Hate speech and offensive language are widespread issues on social media platforms. This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning classification models** to analyze and classify tweets as **Hate Speech, Offensive Language, or Neutral (Non-Hate Speech).**  

---

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
With the increasing volume of online conversations, identifying and moderating **hateful and offensive content** has become a major challenge. This project aims to:  
- **Analyze patterns of hate speech and offensive language in tweets.**  
- **Build a classification model to automatically detect harmful content.**  
- **Improve the efficiency of content moderation using NLP techniques.**

## **SKILL DEMONSTRATION**  
- **Text Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Machine Learning Model Training & Evaluation**  
- **Performance Metrics Analysis (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)**  

---

## **DATA SOURCING**  
The dataset used in this project contains **tweets labeled as**:  
- **Hate Speech (Hate):** Directly targeting a group with hate.  
- **Offensive Language (Offensive):** Contains offensive words but not necessarily hate speech.  
- **Neutral (Non-Hate Speech):** No hate or offensive language.  

---

## **TEXT PREPROCESSING & FEATURE ENGINEERING**  
To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps were performed:  
- **Lowercasing & Removing Punctuation:** Standardizing text.  
- **Tokenization & Stopword Removal:** Filtering out unnecessary words.  
- **Stemming & Lemmatization:** Converting words to their base form.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transforming text into numerical features for model training.  

---

## **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**  
- **Word Cloud Analysis** to visualize frequently used words in tweets.  
- **Class Distribution Analysis** to identify class imbalances.  
- **Bi-gram and Tri-gram Analysis** to detect common phrase patterns in hate speech.  

---

## **MACHINE LEARNING MODELS**  
Several **classification models** were trained and evaluated:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**  
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**  

---

## **MODEL EVALUATION METRICS**  
- **Accuracy Score**  
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**  
- **Confusion Matrix to visualize classification performance**  

---

## **CONCLUSION**  
- **NLP techniques effectively help in classifying tweets based on their content.**  
- **Machine learning models can identify hate speech with reasonable accuracy.**  
- **Further improvements can be made using deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers).**
